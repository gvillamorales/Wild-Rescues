        <p>Welcome to Wild Rescues. Our mission         is to rescue, rehabilitate, and release        wildlife back into their natural               environment. We are a nonprofit                organization dedicated to helping              injured wildlife.</p>
  
        <p>Our staff provides around-the-clock         care for wildlife in need. We also             provide long-term care for wildlife that       cannot be released back into their             natural environment.</p>
  
        <p>Will you partner with us? We need           caring volunteers to help care for our         animals. You can also donate, become a         member, or become a sponsor. Contact us        today.</p>
